The annual ITC Publication Award was given to Nina Amiri for the paper [Estimation of regeneration coverage in a temperate forest by 3D segmentation using airborne laser scanning data](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243416301052). 


Nina is jointly supervised as a PhD student at the Munich University of Applied Sciences and the University of Twente. In the study, a comparison between ground plot data, with three airborne LiDAR images collected between 2009 and 2012, showed that the actual and estimated area of regeneration, agreed with a 70% accuracy. Further, as the amount of canopy cover increased the accuracy mapping forest regeneration decreased. In addition, regenerating forests were more accurately mapped under conifer overstory than deciduous overstory, and [details are available on that page](https://www.itc.nl/Pub/News-overview/2017/in2017-september/Opening-of-the-Academic-Programme-2017-2018.html).

Congratulations to Nina!
