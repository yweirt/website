Since 1st of August 2017, our 3D geospatial vision group has started.

3D geoinformation and computer vision methodology are extremely important to manage, predict and interpret the complex reality. We study and develop techniques to acquire, extract, analyse and model 3D geoinformation. We develop solutions in close collaboration with users such as experts of forestry, smart city, disaster mitigation and ecological modelling. Our group is located within the [Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics](http://www.lsgi.polyu.edu.hk/home/index.asp), since 3D is a key aspect in the design and analysis of interactions in the urban and natual environment. We are therefore very close to the main users of urban and enviromental informatics who can advance in their own domain by using ours and vice versa.

Our group consists of one faculty member and  with different but completing expertise in the domain of 3D modeling: [Wei Yao](https://yweirt.github.io) (3D geospatial vision and intelligence), and several PhD students and research scientists/visitors permanently work on highly relevant topics as you can see on our [staff](/about) and [projects](/projects) pages.

We are looking forward to develop and provide solutions for a solid and sustainable 3D data and technical basis to support existing and new applications!
