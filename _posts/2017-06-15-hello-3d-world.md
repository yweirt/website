Since 1st of August 2017, our 3D geospatial vision group has started.

Our vision is that the reality is complex and constantly changing and therefore 3D geoinformation (outdoor and indoor) is extremely important to manage, predict and maintain the complex reality. We study and develop techniques to model, maintain, analyse and disseminate 3D geoinformation. Serving the nowadays usersâ€™ needs is thereby extremely important and therefore we develop solutions in close collaboration with users such as experts of noise, air and evacuation simulations. We are happy that our group is located within the [Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics](http://www.lsgi.polyu.edu.hk/home/index.asp), since 3D is a key aspect in the design and planning of interventions in the urban environment. We are therefore very close to the main users of 3D geoinformation who can advance in their own domain by using ours and vice versa.

Our group consists of one faculty members with different but completing expertise in the domain of 3D modeling: [Wei Yao](https://yweirt.github.io) (3D geospatial vision and intelligence). Besides ourselves, PhD students and research visitors permanently work on highly relevant topics as you can see on our [staff](/about) and [projects](/projects) pages.

We are looking forward to develop and provide solutions for a solid and sustainable 3D basis to support existing and new applications!
