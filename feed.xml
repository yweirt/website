        <title>Our LiDAR based regeneration mapping paper has won the ITC Publication Award</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual ITC Publication Award was given to Nina Amiri for the paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243416301052&quot;&gt;Estimation of regeneration coverage in a temperate forest by 3D segmentation using airborne laser scanning data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nina is jointly supervised as a PhD student at the Munich University of Applied Sciences and the University of Twente. In the study, a comparison between ground plot data, with three airborne LiDAR images collected between 2009 and 2012, showed that the actual and estimated area of regeneration, agreed with a 70% accuracy. Further, as the amount of canopy cover increased the accuracy mapping forest regeneration decreased. In addition, regenerating forests were more accurately mapped under conifer overstory than deciduous overstory, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itc.nl/Pub/News-overview/2017/in2017-september/Opening-of-the-Academic-Programme-2017-2018.html&quot;&gt;details are available on that page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Nina!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Workshops at ISPRS Geospatial Week 2017 on Laser scanning and Data fusion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On 18-20 September 2017 we have organised &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ipf.kit.edu/laserscanning2017/&quot;&gt;two workshops on Laser scanning and Data fusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the workshop was to bring experts on laser scanning and 3D remote sensing for urban and geospatial applications together and explore potential collaborations. The workshop is organised in relation to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gsw2017.3snews.net/index.php?siteid=2&quot;&gt;ISPRS Geospatial Week 2017 (GSW2017)&lt;/a&gt;, and it involved presentations from academia, industry, and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gsw2017.3snews.net/index.php?siteid=2&quot;&gt;GSW2017&lt;/a&gt; is an talent is educated and engineers, designers, digital engineers and natural/social scientists jointly develop and valorise interdisciplinary metropolitan solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello 3D geospatial world</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 1st of August 2017, our 3D geospatial vision group has started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D geoinformation and computer vision methodology are extremely important to manage, predict and interpret the complex reality. We study and develop multil-modality remote sensing techniques to acquire, extract, analyse and model 3D geoinformation. We develop solutions in close collaboration with users such as experts of forestry, smart city, disaster mitigation and ecological modelling. Our group is located within the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lsgi.polyu.edu.hk/home/index.asp&quot;&gt;Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics&lt;/a&gt;, since 3D is a key aspect in the design and analysis of interactions in the urban and natual environment. We are therefore very close to the main users of urban and enviromental informatics who can advance in their own domain by using ours and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group consists of one faculty member and  with different but completing expertise in the domain of 3D modeling: &lt;a href=&quot;https://yweirt.github.io&quot;&gt;Wei Yao&lt;/a&gt; (3D geospatial vision and intelligence), and several PhD students and research scientists/visitors permanently work on highly relevant topics as you can see on our &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/projects&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to develop and provide solutions for a solid and sustainable 3D data and technical basis to support existing and new applications!&lt;/p&gt;
